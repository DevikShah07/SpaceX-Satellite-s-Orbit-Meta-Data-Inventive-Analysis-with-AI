Satellite Data Analysis and Visualization
This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques on satellite data using Matplotlib and Seaborn. It covers various chart types to analyze and visualize trends, distributions, relationships, and categorical data effectively.

Key Features
Line Plots: Trend analysis and univariate/bivariate plots for time series data.
Bar Charts: Analysis of categorical and nominal data through value counts.
Histograms: Distribution analysis for continuous data.
Scatter Plots: Relationship visualization between numerical variables.
Pie Charts: Proportional representation of categorical data.
Tools Used
Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Seaborn: For enhanced statistical data visualization.

Example Visualizations
The notebook includes examples like:

Distribution of continuous variables using histograms.
Relationship plots between features using scatter plots.
Proportions of categories visualized through pie charts.
Future Enhancements
Incorporating interactive plots using Plotly.
Automating the EDA process for new datasets.
Adding advanced visualizations like heatmaps and pair plots.
